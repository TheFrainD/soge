G\+L\+FW is an Open Source, multi-\/platform library for Open\+GL, Open\+GL ES and Vulkan application development. It provides a simple, platform-\/independent A\+PI for creating windows, contexts and surfaces, reading input, handling events, etc.

G\+L\+FW natively supports Windows, mac\+OS and Linux and other Unix-\/like systems. On Linux both X11 and Wayland are supported.

G\+L\+FW is licensed under the \href{https://www.glfw.org/license.html}{\texttt{ zlib/libpng license}}.

You can \href{https://www.glfw.org/download.html}{\texttt{ download}} the latest stable release as source or Windows binaries, or fetch the {\ttfamily latest} branch from Git\+Hub. Each release starting with 3.\+0 also has a corresponding \href{https://github.com/glfw/glfw/releases}{\texttt{ annotated tag}} with source and binary archives.

The \href{https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/}{\texttt{ documentation}} is available online and is included in all source and binary archives. See the \href{https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/news.html}{\texttt{ release notes}} for new features, caveats and deprecations in the latest release. For more details see the \href{https://www.glfw.org/changelog.html}{\texttt{ version history}}.

The {\ttfamily master} branch is the stable integration branch and {\itshape should} always compile and run on all supported platforms, although details of newly added features may change until they have been included in a release. New features and many bug fixes live in \href{https://github.com/glfw/glfw/branches/all}{\texttt{ other branches}} until they are stable enough to merge.

If you are new to G\+L\+FW, you may find the \href{https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/quick.html}{\texttt{ tutorial}} for G\+L\+FW 3 useful. If you have used G\+L\+FW 2 in the past, there is a \href{https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/moving.html}{\texttt{ transition guide}} for moving to the G\+L\+FW 3 A\+PI.

G\+L\+FW exists because of the contributions of \mbox{\hyperlink{_c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_o_r_s_8md}{many people}} around the world, whether by reporting bugs, providing community support, adding features, reviewing or testing code, debugging, proofreading docs, suggesting features or fixing bugs.\hypertarget{md_deps_glfw__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md69}{}\doxysection{Compiling G\+L\+FW}\label{md_deps_glfw__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md69}
G\+L\+FW itself requires only the headers and libraries for your OS and window system. It does not need the headers for any context creation A\+PI (W\+GL, G\+LX, E\+GL, N\+S\+GL, O\+S\+Mesa) or rendering A\+PI (Open\+GL, Open\+GL ES, Vulkan) to enable support for them.

G\+L\+FW supports compilation on Windows with Visual C++ 2010 and later, Min\+GW and Min\+G\+W-\/w64, on mac\+OS with Clang and on Linux and other Unix-\/like systems with G\+CC and Clang. It will likely compile in other environments as well, but this is not regularly tested.

There are \href{https://www.glfw.org/download.html}{\texttt{ pre-\/compiled Windows binaries}} available for all supported compilers.

See the \href{https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/compile.html}{\texttt{ compilation guide}} for more information about how to compile G\+L\+FW yourself.\hypertarget{md_deps_glfw__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md70}{}\doxysection{Using G\+L\+FW}\label{md_deps_glfw__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md70}
See the \href{https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/}{\texttt{ documentation}} for tutorials, guides and the A\+PI reference.\hypertarget{md_deps_glfw__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md71}{}\doxysection{Contributing to G\+L\+FW}\label{md_deps_glfw__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md71}

G\+L\+FW supports Windows XP and later and mac\+OS 10.\+8 and later. Linux and other Unix-\/like systems running the X Window System are supported even without a desktop environment or modern extensions, although some features require a running window or clipboard manager. The O\+S\+Mesa backend requires Mesa 6.\+3.

See the \href{https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/compat.html}{\texttt{ compatibility guide}} in the documentation for more information.\hypertarget{md_deps_glfw__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md73}{}\doxysection{Dependencies}\label{md_deps_glfw__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md73}
G\+L\+FW itself needs only C\+Make 3.\+1 or later and the headers and libraries for your OS and window system.

The examples and test programs depend on a number of tiny libraries. These are located in the {\ttfamily deps/} directory.
