This is about compiling the G\+L\+FW library itself. For information on how to build applications that use G\+L\+FW, see \mbox{\hyperlink{build_guide}{Building applications}}.\hypertarget{compile_guide_compile_cmake}{}\doxysection{Using C\+Make}\label{compile_guide_compile_cmake}
G\+L\+FW behaves like most other libraries that use C\+Make so this guide mostly describes the standard configure, generate and compile sequence. If you are already familiar with this from other projects, you may want to focus on the \mbox{\hyperlink{compile_guide_compile_deps}{Installing dependencies}} and \mbox{\hyperlink{compile_guide_compile_options}{C\+Make options}} sections for G\+L\+F\+W-\/specific information.

G\+L\+FW uses \href{https://cmake.org/}{\texttt{ C\+Make}} to generate project files or makefiles for your chosen development environment. To compile G\+L\+FW, first generate these files with C\+Make and then use them to compile the G\+L\+FW library.

If you are on Windows and mac\+OS you can \href{https://cmake.org/download/}{\texttt{ download C\+Make}} from their site.

If you are on a Unix-\/like system such as Linux, Free\+B\+SD or Cygwin or have a package system like Fink, Mac\+Ports or Homebrew, you can install its C\+Make package.

C\+Make is a complex tool and this guide will only show a few of the possible ways to set up and compile G\+L\+FW. The C\+Make project has their own much more detailed \href{https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/guide/user-interaction/}{\texttt{ C\+Make user guide}} that includes everything in this guide not specific to G\+L\+FW. It may be a useful companion to this one.\hypertarget{compile_guide_compile_deps}{}\doxysubsection{Installing dependencies}\label{compile_guide_compile_deps}
The C/\+C++ development environments in Visual Studio, Xcode and Min\+GW come with all necessary dependencies for compiling G\+L\+FW, but on Unix-\/like systems like Linux and Free\+B\+SD you will need a few extra packages.\hypertarget{compile_guide_compile_deps_x11}{}\doxysubsubsection{Dependencies for X11}\label{compile_guide_compile_deps_x11}
To compile G\+L\+FW for X11, you need to have the X11 development packages installed. They are not needed to build or run programs that use G\+L\+FW.

On Debian and derivates like Ubuntu and Linux Mint the {\ttfamily xorg-\/dev} meta-\/package pulls in the development packages for all of X11.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo apt install xorg-\/dev}
\end{DoxyCode}


On Fedora and derivatives like Red Hat the X11 extension packages {\ttfamily lib\+Xcursor-\/devel}, {\ttfamily lib\+Xi-\/devel}, {\ttfamily lib\+Xinerama-\/devel} and {\ttfamily lib\+Xrandr-\/devel} required by G\+L\+FW pull in all its other dependencies.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo dnf install libXcursor-\/devel libXi-\/devel libXinerama-\/devel libXrandr-\/devel}
\end{DoxyCode}


On Free\+B\+SD the X11 headers are installed along the end-\/user X11 packages, so if you have an X server running you should have the headers as well. If not, install the {\ttfamily xorgproto} package.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{pkg install xorgproto}
\end{DoxyCode}


On Cygwin the {\ttfamily xorgproto} package in the Devel section of the G\+UI installer will install the headers and other development related files for all of X11.

Once you have the required dependencies, move on to \mbox{\hyperlink{compile_guide_compile_generate}{Generating build files with C\+Make}}.\hypertarget{compile_guide_compile_deps_wayland}{}\doxysubsubsection{Dependencies for Wayland and X11}\label{compile_guide_compile_deps_wayland}
To compile G\+L\+FW for both Wayland and X11, you need to have the X11, Wayland and xkbcommon development packages installed. They are not needed to build or run programs that use G\+L\+FW. You will also need to set the \mbox{\hyperlink{compile_guide_GLFW_BUILD_WAYLAND}{G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+B\+U\+I\+L\+D\+\_\+\+W\+A\+Y\+L\+A\+ND}} C\+Make option in the next step when generating build files.

On Debian and derivates like Ubuntu and Linux Mint you will need the {\ttfamily libwayland-\/dev}, {\ttfamily libxkbcommon-\/dev} and {\ttfamily wayland-\/protocols} packages and the {\ttfamily xorg-\/dev} meta-\/package. These will pull in all other dependencies.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo apt install libwayland-\/dev libxkbcommon-\/dev wayland-\/protocols xorg-\/dev}
\end{DoxyCode}


On Fedora and derivatives like Red Hat you will need the {\ttfamily wayland-\/devel}, {\ttfamily libxkbcommon-\/devel}, {\ttfamily wayland-\/protocols-\/devel}, {\ttfamily lib\+Xcursor-\/devel}, {\ttfamily lib\+Xi-\/devel}, {\ttfamily lib\+Xinerama-\/devel} and {\ttfamily lib\+Xrandr-\/devel} packages. These will pull in all other dependencies.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo dnf install wayland-\/devel libxkbcommon-\/devel wayland-\/protocols-\/devel libXcursor-\/devel libXi-\/devel libXinerama-\/devel libXrandr-\/devel}
\end{DoxyCode}


On Free\+B\+SD you will need the {\ttfamily wayland}, {\ttfamily libxkbcommon} and {\ttfamily wayland-\/protocols} packages. The X11 headers are installed along the end-\/user X11 packages, so if you have an X server running you should have the headers as well. If not, install the {\ttfamily xorgproto} package.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{pkg install wayland libxkbcommon wayland-\/protocols xorgproto}
\end{DoxyCode}


Once you have the required dependencies, move on to \mbox{\hyperlink{compile_guide_compile_generate}{Generating build files with C\+Make}}.\hypertarget{compile_guide_compile_generate}{}\doxysubsection{Generating build files with C\+Make}\label{compile_guide_compile_generate}
Once you have all necessary dependencies it is time to generate the project files or makefiles for your development environment. C\+Make needs two paths for this\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item the path to the root directory of the G\+L\+FW source tree (not its {\ttfamily src} subdirectory)
\item the path to the directory where the generated build files and compiled binaries will be placed
\end{DoxyItemize}

If these are the same, it is called an in-\/tree build, otherwise it is called an out-\/of-\/tree build.

Out-\/of-\/tree builds are recommended as they avoid cluttering up the source tree. They also allow you to have several build directories for different configurations all using the same source tree.

A common pattern when building a single configuration is to have a build directory named {\ttfamily build} in the root of the source tree.\hypertarget{compile_guide_compile_generate_gui}{}\doxysubsubsection{Generating with the C\+Make G\+UI}\label{compile_guide_compile_generate_gui}
Start the C\+Make G\+UI and set the paths to the source and build directories described above. Then press {\itshape Configure} and {\itshape Generate}.

If you wish change any C\+Make variables in the list, press {\itshape Configure} and then {\itshape Generate} to have the new values take effect. The variable list will be populated after the first configure step.

By default G\+L\+FW will use X11 on Linux and other Unix-\/like systems other than mac\+OS. To include support for Wayland as well, set the \mbox{\hyperlink{compile_guide_GLFW_BUILD_WAYLAND}{G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+B\+U\+I\+L\+D\+\_\+\+W\+A\+Y\+L\+A\+ND}} option in the G\+L\+FW section of the variable list, then apply the new value as described above.

Once you have generated the project files or makefiles for your chosen development environment, move on to \mbox{\hyperlink{compile_guide_compile_compile}{Compiling the library}}.\hypertarget{compile_guide_compile_generate_cli}{}\doxysubsubsection{Generating with command-\/line C\+Make}\label{compile_guide_compile_generate_cli}
To make a build directory, pass the source and build directories to the {\ttfamily cmake} command. These can be relative or absolute paths. The build directory is created if it doesn\textquotesingle{}t already exist.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/S path/to/glfw -\/B path/to/build}
\end{DoxyCode}


It is common to name the build directory {\ttfamily build} and place it in the root of the source tree when only planning to build a single configuration.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd path/to/glfw}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/S . -\/B build}
\end{DoxyCode}


Without other flags these will generate Visual Studio project files on Windows and makefiles on other platforms. You can choose other targets using the {\ttfamily -\/G} flag.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/S path/to/glfw -\/B path/to/build -\/G Xcode}
\end{DoxyCode}


By default G\+L\+FW will use X11 on Linux and other Unix-\/like systems other than mac\+OS. To also include support for Wayland, set the \mbox{\hyperlink{compile_guide_GLFW_BUILD_WAYLAND}{G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+B\+U\+I\+L\+D\+\_\+\+W\+A\+Y\+L\+A\+ND}} C\+Make option.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/S path/to/glfw -\/B path/to/build -\/D GLFW\_BUILD\_WAYLAND=1}
\end{DoxyCode}


Once you have generated the project files or makefiles for your chosen development environment, move on to \mbox{\hyperlink{compile_guide_compile_compile}{Compiling the library}}.\hypertarget{compile_guide_compile_compile}{}\doxysubsection{Compiling the library}\label{compile_guide_compile_compile}
You should now have all required dependencies and the project files or makefiles necessary to compile G\+L\+FW. Go ahead and compile the actual G\+L\+FW library with these files as you would with any other project.

With Visual Studio open {\ttfamily G\+L\+F\+W.\+sln} and use the Build menu. With Xcode open {\ttfamily G\+L\+F\+W.\+xcodeproj} and use the Project menu.

With Linux, mac\+OS and other forms of Unix, run {\ttfamily make}.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd path/to/build}
\DoxyCodeLine{make}
\end{DoxyCode}


With Min\+GW, it is {\ttfamily mingw32-\/make}.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd path/to/build}
\DoxyCodeLine{mingw32-\/make}
\end{DoxyCode}


Any C\+Make build directory can also be built with the {\ttfamily cmake} command and the {\ttfamily -\/-\/build} flag.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/-\/build path/to/build}
\end{DoxyCode}


This will run the platform specific build tool the directory was generated for.

Once the G\+L\+FW library is compiled you are ready to build your application, linking it to the G\+L\+FW library. See \mbox{\hyperlink{build_guide}{Building applications}} for more information.\hypertarget{compile_guide_compile_options}{}\doxysection{C\+Make options}\label{compile_guide_compile_options}
The C\+Make files for G\+L\+FW provide a number of options, although not all are available on all supported platforms. Some of these are de facto standards among projects using C\+Make and so have no {\ttfamily G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+} prefix.

If you are using the G\+UI version of C\+Make, these are listed and can be changed from there. If you are using the command-\/line version of C\+Make you can use the {\ttfamily ccmake} ncurses G\+UI to set options. Some package systems like Ubuntu and other distributions based on Debian G\+N\+U/\+Linux have this tool in a separate {\ttfamily cmake-\/curses-\/gui} package.

Finally, if you don\textquotesingle{}t want to use any G\+UI, you can set options from the {\ttfamily cmake} command-\/line with the {\ttfamily -\/D} flag.

When set, the value of this option must be a valid C\+Make library type. Set it to {\ttfamily S\+T\+A\+T\+IC} to build G\+L\+FW as a static library, {\ttfamily S\+H\+A\+R\+ED} to build it as a shared library / dynamic library / D\+LL, or {\ttfamily O\+B\+J\+E\+CT} to make G\+L\+FW a C\+Make object library.

This is enabled by default.\hypertarget{compile_guide_compile_mingw_cross}{}\doxysection{Cross-\/compilation with C\+Make and Min\+GW}\label{compile_guide_compile_mingw_cross}
Both Cygwin and many Linux distributions have Min\+GW or Min\+G\+W-\/w64 packages. For example, Cygwin has the {\ttfamily mingw64-\/i686-\/gcc} and {\ttfamily mingw64-\/x86\+\_\+64-\/gcc} packages for 32-\/ and 64-\/bit version of Min\+G\+W-\/w64, while Debian G\+N\+U/\+Linux and derivatives like Ubuntu have the {\ttfamily mingw-\/w64} package for both.

G\+L\+FW has C\+Make toolchain files in the {\ttfamily C\+Make} subdirectory that set up cross-\/compilation of Windows binaries. To use these files you set the {\ttfamily C\+M\+A\+K\+E\+\_\+\+T\+O\+O\+L\+C\+H\+A\+I\+N\+\_\+\+F\+I\+LE} C\+Make variable with the {\ttfamily -\/D} flag add an option when configuring and generating the build files.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/S path/to/glfw -\/B path/to/build -\/D CMAKE\_TOOLCHAIN\_FILE=path/to/file}
\end{DoxyCode}


The exact toolchain file to use depends on the prefix used by the Min\+GW or Min\+G\+W-\/w64 binaries on your system. You can usually see this in the /usr directory. For example, both the Ubuntu and Cygwin Min\+G\+W-\/w64 packages have {\ttfamily /usr/x86\+\_\+64-\/w64-\/mingw32} for the 64-\/bit compilers, so the correct invocation would be\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/S path/to/glfw -\/B path/to/build -\/D CMAKE\_TOOLCHAIN\_FILE=CMake/x86\_64-\/w64-\/mingw32.cmake}
\end{DoxyCode}


The path to the toolchain file is relative to the path to the G\+L\+FW source tree passed to the {\ttfamily -\/S} flag, not to the current directory.

For more details see the \href{https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-toolchains.7.html}{\texttt{ C\+Make toolchain guide}}.\hypertarget{compile_guide_compile_manual}{}\doxysection{Compiling G\+L\+F\+W manually}\label{compile_guide_compile_manual}
If you wish to compile G\+L\+FW without its C\+Make build environment then you will have to do at least some of the platform detection yourself. There are preprocessor macros for enabling support for the platforms (window systems) available. There are also optional, platform-\/specific macros for various features.

When building, G\+L\+FW will expect the necessary configuration macros to be defined on the command-\/line. The G\+L\+FW C\+Make files set these as private compile definitions on the G\+L\+FW target but if you compile the G\+L\+FW sources manually you will need to define them yourself.

The window system is used to create windows, handle input, monitors, gamma ramps and clipboard. The options are\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{\+\_\+\+G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+C\+O\+C\+OA}} to use the Cocoa frameworks
\item {\bfseries{\+\_\+\+G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+W\+I\+N32}} to use the Win32 A\+PI
\item {\bfseries{\+\_\+\+G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+X11}} to use the X Window System
\item {\bfseries{\+\_\+\+G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+W\+A\+Y\+L\+A\+ND}} to use the Wayland A\+PI (incomplete)
\end{DoxyItemize}

The {\bfseries{\+\_\+\+G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+W\+A\+Y\+L\+A\+ND}} and {\bfseries{\+\_\+\+G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+X11}} macros may be combined and produces a library that attempts to detect the appropriate platform at initialization.

If you are building G\+L\+FW as a shared library / dynamic library / D\+LL then you must also define {\bfseries{\+\_\+\+G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+B\+U\+I\+L\+D\+\_\+\+D\+LL}}. Otherwise, you must not define it.

If you are using a custom name for the Vulkan, E\+GL, G\+LX, O\+S\+Mesa, Open\+GL, G\+L\+E\+Sv1 or G\+L\+E\+Sv2 library, you can override the default names by defining those you need of {\bfseries{\+\_\+\+G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+V\+U\+L\+K\+A\+N\+\_\+\+L\+I\+B\+R\+A\+RY}}, {\bfseries{\+\_\+\+G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+E\+G\+L\+\_\+\+L\+I\+B\+R\+A\+RY}}, {\bfseries{\+\_\+\+G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+G\+L\+X\+\_\+\+L\+I\+B\+R\+A\+RY}}, {\bfseries{\+\_\+\+G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+O\+S\+M\+E\+S\+A\+\_\+\+L\+I\+B\+R\+A\+RY}}, {\bfseries{\+\_\+\+G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+O\+P\+E\+N\+G\+L\+\_\+\+L\+I\+B\+R\+A\+RY}}, {\bfseries{\+\_\+\+G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+G\+L\+E\+S\+V1\+\_\+\+L\+I\+B\+R\+A\+RY}} and {\bfseries{\+\_\+\+G\+L\+F\+W\+\_\+\+G\+L\+E\+S\+V2\+\_\+\+L\+I\+B\+R\+A\+RY}}. Otherwise, G\+L\+FW will use the built-\/in default names.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
None of the \mbox{\hyperlink{build_guide_build_macros}{G\+L\+FW header option macros}} may be defined during the compilation of G\+L\+FW. If you define any of these in your build files, make sure they are not applied to the G\+L\+FW sources. 
\end{DoxyNote}
